# WingOfIcarus

Current Version 1.0.5

Written for our personal Minecraft server that is running Spigot 1.8.x. Spigot 1.8.x API was but it should work as long as the API does not drastically change.

Description:
- Take to the skies, temporarily, by using Feathers!

Usage:
- No commands. Simply right-click using a Feather to enable and disable Flight.

Changelog
- Version 1.0.5
    - Fixed right-clicking issue.
    - Left clicking displays how many feathers and how much flight left is left.
    - Decrementing feathers in your inventory take from the last stack of feathers now.
        - Changed because decrementing feathers from the first stack in your inventory made it inconvenient in trying to disable flight.
- Version 1.0.0
    - Initial commit -- allows player to gain Flight by using up feathers in the process.
